<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a highly motivated and ambitious Computer Engineering student, passionate about bridging the gap between hardware and software to create innovative solutions. My academic journey has given me a strong foundation in core areas such as computer architecture, microprocessors, embedded systems, digital circuits, and algorithms, while also developing my skills in software engineering and programming languages like C, C++, Python, and Java. 

  I am particularly fascinated by how hardware and software interact to shape the technology we use every day, and I am eager to explore emerging fields like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and Internet of Things (IoT). I enjoy applying theoretical knowledge to practical projects, whether designing efficient systems, building prototypes, or troubleshooting complex problems. Through hands-on experience in internships, research projects, and personal ventures, I’ve gained valuable exposure to real-world engineering challenges and honed my abilities in systems design, data analysis, and troubleshooting.
  
  Driven by a passion for continuous learning, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the field of computer engineering by developing solutions that push the boundaries of what’s possible. With a combination of strong technical skills, creativity, and an unwavering commitment to excellence, I am excited to take on new challenges and help shape the future of technology..</p>
